A front end interface for viewing and editing a shared chore calender.

~Data generated via branch of [ics-chore-chart](https://github.com/RealWeeks/ics-chore-chart).~
Data pulled from [chore-back](https://github.com/RealWeeks/chore-back).(10/19/2018).

Future plans include an API for calender subscription and management.
Maybe ported mobile app depending on how busy I get.
